# kicad-lib
KiCad libraries made by me

## lib_own
My own libraries - my own symbols, my own footprints.

## lib_inherited
Libraries with objects inherited from others libraries - usually footprints, sometimes graphical symbols like caps, resistors, opamps, transistors (i don't like drawing anything else but boxes with pins).
